Use the open source software "MuseScore" to create a score and save the
output to `file`. MuseScore must be accessible from the command line
for this to work (add the path to `MuseScore.exe` to your PATH environment
variable).

By default it will also display the created `file`,
which can be either a `.pdf` or a `.png`.
The function must first create a MIDI file (uses the same name as `file`).
You can choose to keep it with `rmmidi = false`.

If given a `.png` the actual file name will end with `-1`, `-2` etc.
for each page of the score.
